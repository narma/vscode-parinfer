> __NOTE__: Development is currently paused as I have focused on maintaining [atom-parinfer] to prove out the new Smart Mode changes.  Once that is done, my plan is to come back to this plugin to integrate those same changes hereâ€”hopefully in a way that shares some code between them if possible.  Sorry, I will be back!
